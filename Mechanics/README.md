## Cad design:

  The cads of all prototypes are presented in this section. All parts and assembly are made on SolidWorks 2020.
  
  Here are the list of all the materials used for the final prototype :
  
      - Wooden parts:
      
          Top platforms
          
      - 3D printed plastic parts:
      
          Motor's holders
          
          Motor's axles
          
          Motor's axles holders
          
          Motor's arms
          
      - Molded plastic:
      
          Motor's frames
          
          Top pivot's holders
          
      - Metal:

          Every screws and nuts
          
          Base platform
          
          Joints
      
 Notes:   
 
   OpenCR and RaspberryPi are approximated by the middle box.

## Dynamic modelisation:

  The MG code is used to generate the matlab code wich is then used with an extension
  (matlab coder) to provide the .c or .cpp files wich will be implemented with the openCR card.
  
  Tests are still comming in order to assure the efficiency and to have our model limits.
