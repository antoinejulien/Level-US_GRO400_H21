## Cad design:

  The cad of the first working prototype are presented in the CAD_prototype2 folder.
  
  All parts and assembly are made on SolidWorks.
  
      - Wooden parts:
      
          every plateform or arms involving relativly big parts
          
      - 3D printed plastic parts:
      
          motors holders
          
          motor's axles
          
          motor's axles holders
          
      - Molded plastic:
      
          motor's frames
          
          top pivot's holders
          
      - Metal:

          every screws and nuts
      
 notes:   
 
   OpenCR and RaspberryPi are approximated by the middle box.

## MotionGenesis:

  The code is running the definition of the model.
  
  It is still a work in progress to obtain the angular position of the motors.
