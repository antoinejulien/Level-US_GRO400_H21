## Cad design:

  The cad of the first working prototype are presented in the CAD_prototype2 folder.
  
  All parts and assembly are made on SolidWorks.
  
      - Wooden parts:
      
          every plateform or arms involving relativly big parts
          
      - 3D printed plastic parts:
      
          motors holders
          
          motor's axles
          
          motor's axles holders
          
      - Molded plastic:
      
          motor's frames
          
          top pivot's holders
          
      - Metal:

          every screws and nuts
      
 notes:   
 
   OpenCR and RaspberryPi are approximated by the middle box.

## Dynamic modelisation:

  The MG code is used to generate the matlab code wich is then used with an extension
  (matlab coder) to provide the .c or .cpp files wich will be implemented with the openCR card.
  
  Tests are still comming in order to assure the efficiency and to have our model limits.
